Supports single-stock queries as well as batch requests for multiple stock symbols.

---

## Features

- Get the latest stock price and daily change percentage for a single symbol.
- Fetch multiple stocks at once using a single request.
- Modular architecture: routes, services, and optional API key protection.
- Ready for future expansion with technical indicators or sentiment analysis.
